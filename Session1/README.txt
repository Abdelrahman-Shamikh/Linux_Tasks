 Create Your Directory

    Open a terminal on your Linux system.
    Create a directory with your first and last names, including spaces. Use the appropriate command to create the directory.
    Change your current working directory to the newly created directory.

2. Make Another Directory and Create Multiple Files

    Inside your directory, create another directory named "Documents."
    Change your current working directory to the "Documents" subdirectory.
    Create three text files named "file1.txt," "file2.txt," and "file3.txt" within the "Documents" directory, all at once using a single command.
    Verify that all three files are created inside the "Documents" directory.

3. Hide a File

    Go back to your main directory (the one with your first and last names) using the appropriate command.
    Create a hidden file named ".hidden_file" within the main directory.
    Use the appropriate command to verify that the hidden file is created.

4. Write with Nano

    Use the Nano text editor to write a short message inside the "file1.txt" file you created in Step 2.
    Save the changes and exit Nano.
    Display the contents of the "file1.txt" file to ensure your changes are saved.

5. Go Back

    Return to the "Documents" directory using the appropriate command.

6. Create a Unique Directory

    Create a new directory named "-" (a hyphen) within the "Documents" directory.
    Change your current working directory to this newly created directory.

7. Copy Directory

    Copy the "Documents" directory (and all its contents) to your main directory (the one with your first and last names) using the appropriate command. Give the copied directory a different name (e.g., "My_Documents").
    Verify that the copy was successful by listing the contents of your main directory.

8. Show Hidden Content

    Display the content of the ".hidden_file" you created in Step 3.

9. Move Files

    Move the "file2.txt" and "file3.txt" files from the "Documents" directory to your main directory (the one with your first and last names) using the appropriate command.
    Verify that the files are moved successfully.

10. Remove Your Directory

    Go back to your home directory using the appropriate command.
    Remove your main directory (the one with your first and last names) using the appropriate command.
    Verify that the main directory is successfully removed.
